3)Injection (application accepts data as input and processes it as an instruction rather than just as data) (Cross side , sql)
4)Insecure design (The error includes the exact location of an important configuration file.)
5)Security misconfiguration (change defult password)(center of internet security CIS guideline)
6)Vulnerable and outdated components (use unsupported or outdated tool)
7)Identification and authentication failures
8)Software and data integrity failures 
9)Security logging and monitoring failures
10)Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
