Pros and cons of using stored procedures compared to SQL statements stored in Java code:

Pros:

    Stored procedures can be faster than SQL statements because they are compiled and optimized by the DBMS.
    Stored procedures can be more secure than SQL statements because they can be granted specific permissions and access controls.
    Stored procedures can be easier to maintain because they are stored in the database and can be updated independently of the Java code.

Cons:

    Stored procedures can be more complex to write and test than SQL statements because they require knowledge of the DBMS and its programming language.
    Stored procedures can be less portable than SQL statements because they are specific to a particular DBMS and may require modification if you switch to a different DBMS.
    Stored procedures can be less flexible than SQL statements because they are precompiled and cannot be easily modified at runtime.

Difficulties when working with large binary files:

    Large binary files can take up a lot of memory and cause performance issues if not handled correctly.
    Large binary files may need to be split into smaller chunks or streamed in order to avoid memory issues.
    Large binary files may need to be compressed or otherwise optimized to reduce their size before storing them in the database.
